# Author:  Joe Gervais (TryCatchHCF)
#
# Summary:  Exfiltration toolset (see cloakify.py) that transforms data into lists 
# of words / phrases / Unicode to ease exfiltration of data across monitored networks, 
# essentially hiding the data in plain sight, and facilitate social engineering attacks 
# against human analysts and their workflows. Bonus Feature: Defeats signature-based 
# malware detection tools (cloak your other tools).
#
# Used by cloakifyFactory.py, can be used as a standalone script as well (example below).
#
# Description:  Decodes the output of cloakify.py into its underlying Base64 format, 
# then does Base64 decoding to unpack the cloaked payload file. Requires the use of the 
# same cipher that was used to cloak the file prior to exfitration, of course.
#
# Prepackaged ciphers include: lists of desserts in English, Arabic, Thai, Russian, 
# Hindi, Chinese, Persian, and Muppet (Swedish Chef); Top 100 IP Addresses; GeoCoords of 
# World Capitols; MD5 Password Hashes; An Emoji cipher; Star Trek characters; Geocaching 
# Locations; Amphibians (Scientific Names); and evadeAV cipher, a simple cipher that 
# minimizes the size of the resulting obfuscated data.
# 
# Example:  
#
#   $ ./decloakify.py cloakedPayload.txt ciphers/desserts.ciph 
# Updated to Python3 by John Aho
